- No longer creates an empty span at the end of the previous paragraph or at the start of the next paragraph it no contents are in them.

Improve the undo function:

- No longer opens the item clicked if Shift or Ctrl key is down for multiple selection.
- All highlights and annotations are added "data-sb-obj" attribute for better scripting or automation.
