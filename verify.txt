
Indexes:
- Index is correctly generated when the order is changed
- Index is correctly loaded and the order is restored

create/modifyTime:
- modifyTime is correctly read for files
- modifyTime is correctly read for directories
- createTime equals modifyTime at this point
- setting modifyTime is silently ignored

Locks:
- Lock is correct when the file is read-only
- Lock is correct when the file is writeable
- Lock is invisible and false for folders
  For folders, read-only flag means a different thing under Windows. Luckily, Scrapbook
  never supported the flag for folders anyway.
- Read-only is correctly set when lock is set
- Read-only is correctly cleared when lock is set

Basic external properties:
- Comment, icon, source can be edited for a note
- Comment, icon, source props are stored in index.dat
- Index.dat is successfully loaded after restart
- Comment, icon, source are correct in note properties.
